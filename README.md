# Opengovsg Best Practices

This are the best practices that the opengovsg team are using. It's meant to be a reference for teams especially when starting new projects.

## Linting

### Setup

#### IDE/Editor

Most IDEs/text editors have some way to enable automatic linting of the files you're editing. Here's a list of editors + plugins that the team are using:

* Sublime Text + [SublimeLinter](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter)
  * Provide sublime text setup for linting here
* Atom - ???
* VS Code + ESLint + Document This
* People who use other editors can add their own setups here

TODO: Flesh out with more examples

#### Git Hooks

A recommended way to enforce linting in a codebase is to set up [git hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/gr/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) to lint the codebase. This will help to ensure that the git history is tidy and that all pull requests meet the code style/formatting standards, preventing code reviews from being cluttered with basic comments on code style/formatting.

Recommended hooks: `pre-commit` or `pre-push`

Sample setup: beeline-frontend

1. Install the [`pre-commit` npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pre-commit) to set up the git `pre-commit` hook
1. Configure `pre-commit` to run an npm script in `package.json` ([see here](https://github.com/datagovsg/beeline-frontend/blob/715d478db76a903f1534157228539a8bdde9e032/package.json#L163-L165))
1. Install the [`lint-staged` npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lint-staged) to only run linter against staged files
1. Configure `lint-staged` to only look for `*.js` files (optionally automatically `git add`) ([see here](https://github.com/datagovsg/beeline-frontend/blob/715d478db76a903f1534157228539a8bdde9e032/package.json#L166-L171))

#### CI

Linting should also be done as part of the CI process. A common setup in the team is to use [Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/). A sample Travis YAML file can be [found here](/linting/.travis.yml).

### JavaScript

#### eslint config

The team has a standard eslint config that every project should use as a base config before extending it where necessary. It's available as an npm package - instructions to install and use can be [found here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opengovsg/eslint-config-opengovsg).

An example of how to use this can be [seen here](https://github.com/datagovsg/beeline-frontend/pull/658/commits/25704f0a0e0ced181923667dee6742eb4937bf02). Pay special attention to `.eslintrc.json` and how to extend the base config to suit individual project needs (e.g. unique global variables for angular projects).

TODO:
* Add addtional eslint plugins which can provide useful static analysis:
  * [eslint-plugin-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-node) and [eslint-plugin-import](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import) (untested)
    * Makes sure you require available files and modules
  * [eslint-plugin-promise](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-promise)
    * Makes sure promises are used correctly

* Add links to good tutorials (for onboarding)

## GitHub

### Branching strategy
* Maintain a mainline and release branch, both protected
* Changes in mainline branch can be moved to the release branch through one of the following:
  * Raising a PR merging mainline changes into release  
    Recommended - the release branch clearly indicates what changes the releases
    have, making rollbacks easier and less error-prone to execute.
  * `git fetch && git checkout <mainline-name> && git pull && git push origin <mainline-name>:<release-name>`  
    Discouraged - while it leads to a cleaner commit tree (since both branches end up on the 
    same sequence of commits), switching between releases is more prone to human error 
    (though this can be mitigated using release tags), and requires a fair understanding of git 
    and using git via the command line. That said, this facilitates more precise control over
    what is released, at the commit level.
    
* Feature branches should hang off and merge into the mainline branch
  * Favour rebasing over merging to update feature branches
  * Keep feature branches **small**. This makes the PR easier to understand,
    and also makes it easier to rebase the feature branch on mainline should
    the need arise
  * If implementing a feature will take too many commits or too much change, 
    you might be undertaking too much work in one go. If so, split the work
    into more manageable chunks

* Hotfixes and trivial changes can be squashed as a single commit onto mainline

See Atlassian's article on [Gitflow Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow), on which our strategy is loosely based on

### Branch naming

* Mainline and release branches can have the following respective names:
  * `master` and `release`
  * `master` and `production`
  * `develop` and `master`
  * Any pair of names that conveys the sense that one branch is more stable
    than the other

* Branch names should be kebab-case (ie, small caps only, hyphen as word separator)
* Optionally, branch names can be prefixed by a category name followed by /, 
  * eg. feature/more-cowbell or hotfix/intermittent-hackfix

### Writing commits
See [How to Write a Git Commit](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)

## Node Dev Setup

When you're developing, you want to see your changes reflect automatically. 
Various packages can automatically watch for changes and restart your build and run steps.

* `nodemon` to restart your server
* `webpack --watch` to build static assets 
* `http-server` - to host static assets
* `concurrently` - to run multiple processes in a single command via npm, eg `webpack --watch` and `nodemon`
